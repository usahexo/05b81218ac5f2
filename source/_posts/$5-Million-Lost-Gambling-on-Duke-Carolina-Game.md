#  $5 Million Lost Gambling on Duke-Carolina Game

A gambler in North Carolina may have lost $5 million on the Duke-Carolina game Saturday.

The gambler, who has not been identified, placed a bet of $1 million on each team to win. When Duke won by two points, the gambler lost all of his money.

"This is a huge loss for the individual," said one source familiar with the situation. "It's going to take some time to recover from this."

While it's unknown where the gambler placed his bet, offshore sportsbooks are a likely possibility. It's believed that the gambler took out a loan to cover his losses.

This isn't the first time a large wager has been placed on a Duke-Carolina game. In 2013, a UK bookmaker took a £1 million bet on the rivalry matchup. That bet resulted in a £200,000 profit for the bookmaker when Duke won by one point.

#  $1.3M Bet on Duke-Carolina Match Up

In what is being called the "biggest wager of the college basketball season", somebody has placed a $1.3 million bet on the Duke-Carolina match up.

This is not the first high-stakes wager on this year's college basketball tournament. Earlier in the week, a bettor put $1 million on Texas Tech to win the championship.

However, this latest bet dwarfs all others. The Duke-Carolina game is one of the most anticipated matchups of the tournament, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.

Carolina is the favorite going into the game, but Duke has proved that they are capable of winning even against the odds. With so much money at stake, it should be a very exciting match up to watch.

#  Casino Mohawk Loses $1M on Duke-Carolina Betting

#  $500,000 Wagered on Duke-Carolina Game

A $500,000 wager was placed on the Duke-Carolina game Wednesday night. Bets were placed at both the Mirage and Caesars Palace sports books in Las Vegas. The money is being wagered on the point spread, with Carolina a 6-point favorite. 

“It’s a rivalry game and there’s always a lot of money bet on it, but this is one of the larger wagers we’ve taken,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports operations at the Westgate SuperBook.

Interest in this year’s matchup is high because both teams are ranked in the top 10. Duke is No. 9 and Carolina is No. 3. 

The two schools have a long and storied rivalry that began in 1893. The Blue Devils lead the all-time series 73-47, but Carolina has won the last four meetings.

#  Sportsbook loses big as Duke falls to Carolina

In what can only be called a major upset, the University of North Carolina Tar Heels handily defeated the Duke Blue Devils in this weekend’s matchup. The final score was 85-65 in UNC’s favor, and as a result, sportsbook Bettor X is out quite a bit of money.

Bettor X had made a large bet on Duke to win, and when the team fell apart against their arch-rivals, the payout was significant. Said one industry insider, “This was a really big game, and so when Duke lost, it really hurt Bettor X. They lost quite a bit of money on that game.”

It’s unclear whether or not Bettor X will continue to bet on college basketball games, but it’s safe to say that they won’t be forgetting this loss anytime soon.
