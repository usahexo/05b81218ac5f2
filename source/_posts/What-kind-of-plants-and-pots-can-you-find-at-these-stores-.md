#  What kind of plants and pots can you find at these stores? 

Most nurseries have a great variety of both plants and containers to choose from. You can find everything from small 2” pots to huge, landscape-sized containers. Some stores even have a greenhouse where you can find exotic plants not typically found at your local nursery.

When choosing plants, think about the sun exposure your garden gets. Plants that need full sun should be placed in an area that receives direct sunlight for most of the day. Partial sun or shady plants can be placed in areas that get dappled sunlight or are mostly shady.

Always read the plant tag before purchasing to make sure you are getting a plant that is appropriate for your growing conditions.

When it comes to containers, there are endless possibilities! Terra cotta, plastic, metal, and concrete pots are all popular choices. Be sure to pick a pot that is large enough for the plant you are buying – you don’t want it to look scrawny or be too heavy to move once it’s full of soil and plants.

If you are looking for a unique pot for your garden, check out some of the specialty stores mentioned earlier. They often have exclusive items you won’t find elsewhere.

#  What are the prices like? 

Prices for accommodation in Japan vary greatly depending on the location and type of accommodation. The average price for a hostel dormitory room is around ¥3,000 per night, while private rooms can cost anywhere from ¥10,000 to ¥50,000 per night. Ryokan (traditional Japanese inns) are often the most expensive option and can cost upwards of ¥15,000 per night. Hotel rates tend to be lower than ryokan, with an average price of around ¥8,000 per night. 

There are a number of websites that allow you to compare prices for different types of accommodation in Japan. Two popular ones are Jalan and Rakuten Travel.

#  How large are the stores? 
The stores are typically big, occupying a lot of space. For example, the warehouses are around 150,000 square feet and the stores are around 25,000 square feet.

#  What kind of atmosphere do they have? 

There is no one answer to this question - as every brewery has its own unique style and atmosphere - but in general, breweries can be broken down into two categories: the industrial-style breweries and the taproom-style breweries.

Industrial-style breweries are typically located in warehouses or other large, open spaces. They often have high ceilings, exposed brick walls, and concrete floors. The focus is on the beer, and the brewery is more of a production facility than a place for people to gather and socialize.

Taproom-style breweries are smaller, typically with limited seating. They have a more intimate feel, with décor that often reflects the brewery's location or theme. The focus is on providing a space for people to come together and enjoy good beer.

#  Do they offer any services or plants classes?
