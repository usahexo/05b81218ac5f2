#  Mohawk Casino Reopens After Suspension

The Mohawk Casino has announced that it will reopen its doors to the public on Friday following a two-day suspension.

The Ontario Gaming, Racing and Wagering Commission ordered the casino to close its doors on Monday after an incident in which a patron was suspected of cheating.

The Commission released a statement saying that it had "reasonable grounds to believe that an incident of cheating occurred" at the casino over the weekend.

No details have been released about the alleged cheating incident, but the casino has said that it is cooperating with the Commission's investigation.

In a statement posted to its website, the Mohawk Casino said that it is "committed to providing our guests with a safe and enjoyable gaming experience."

#  Mistress of Fortune Game Returns to Mohawk Casino

The popular Mistress of Fortune slot game is making a return to the Mohawk Casino Resort in upstate New York. The game, which was pulled from the casino floor last year, will be available starting Friday, March 16.

According to Mohawk officials, the game was pulled because of its popularity. Guests were spending too much time playing it, and not enough on other games. But after consulting with guests and staff, officials decided to bring it back.

“We are excited to bring Mistress of Fortune back to our guests,” said Director of Slot Operations Rich Moran. “This is a highly popular game and we know that our guests will enjoy playing it once again.”

The game is a five-reel, 20-payline title that features a variety of bonus rounds, including free spins and multipliers. It’s based on the ancient Chinese game of mahjong and includes symbols such as dragons, fans and lanterns.

Mohawk Casino Resort is located in Schenectady County and features more than 2,000 slot machines and over 60 table games. It also has a hotel with nearly 200 rooms, as well as several restaurants and bars.
