#  What will be the best plants to grow in 2022?

It is hard to predict what will be the best plants to grow in 2022. However, we can make some educated guesses.

Some plants that are currently popular may lose their appeal by 2022. For example, lavender may not be as popular in five years since it is currently becoming over-saturated in the market.

On the other hand, some plants that are not currently popular may become more popular by 2022. Succulents, for example, are becoming more and more popular in interior design. They are low maintenance and come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so they would make a good choice for anyone looking to garden in 2022.

Another plant that is gaining popularity is bamboo. It is a versatile plant that can be used for both food and shelter. It also grows quickly, making it a good choice for anyone looking for a fast-growing plant.

Ultimately, predicting which plants will be popular in 2022 is difficult. However, by considering current trends and the needs of people in 2022, we can make some educated guesses about which plants will be most popular then.

#  What type of pots will be the most popular for plants in 2022?

It is hard to say exactly what type of pots will be the most popular for plants in 2022, as this can depend on a number of factors, such as the trendiness of certain pot styles and what types of plants are currently popular. However, we can make some predictions based on current trends.

One possibility is that terra-cotta pots will continue to be popular. They have a natural look and feel that many people find appealing, and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Additionally, terra-cotta pots are relatively affordable, which makes them a popular choice for budget-conscious gardeners.

Another option is that concrete or ceramic pots will become more popular. These pots are typically more expensive than terra-cotta pots, but they often last longer and look more elegant. Additionally, they can be customized to fit any décor, making them a great choice for gardeners who want their plants to coordinate with their home's aesthetic.

Ultimately, it is hard to say which type of pot will be the most popular in 2022. However, we can be sure that there will be a wide variety of options available so that gardeners can find the perfect pot for their needs and style.
