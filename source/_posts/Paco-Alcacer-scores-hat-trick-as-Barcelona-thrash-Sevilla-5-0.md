#  Paco Alcacer scores hat-trick as Barcelona thrash Sevilla 5-0

Paco Alcacer scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona as the Catalans hammered Sevilla 5-0 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night.

The Spanish striker, who was making only his second league start of the season, opened the scoring in the 15th minute after pouncing on a mistake from Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico.

Philippe Coutinho then made it 2-0 in the 29th minute with a superb curling effort, and Alcacer added his second goal of the night just before half-time.

Coutinho got his second goal of the evening in the 74th minute, before Alcacer completed his hat-trick with a well-taken finish in the 86th minute.

The win sees Barcelona move back to within four points of La Liga leaders Real Madrid, while Sevilla remain in fifth place.
